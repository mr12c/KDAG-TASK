**Prerequisites**

- **Git:** Ensure you have Git installed on your system. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Node.js and npm:** Verify you have Node.js and npm installed. You can obtain them from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en). Check their versions using `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

**Forking the Repository**

1. Visit the project repository on GitHub or your preferred hosting platform.
2. Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the repository.

**Cloning Your Forked Repository**

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Use the following command to clone your forked repository, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the actual repository name:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

**Installing Dependencies**

1. Run the following command in your terminal to install all required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This command fetches the necessary modules from the npm registry and installs them in your project's `node_modules` directory.

**Running the Project**
 
 

**Running `npm run dev`**

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your project where the `package.json` file resides.
2. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will trigger the commands defined in the `dev` script according to your project's setup.

**Key Points:**

- The actual commands executed by `npm run dev` depend on your project's configuration.
- Common tasks within `dev` scripts include starting a development server, file watching for hot reloading, and potentially running tests or linters.
- Always refer to your project's documentation or code for specific details.

By understanding this structure and keeping in mind the project-specific nature of `npm run dev`, you can effectively utilize it to initiate development workflows.
